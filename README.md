# Regista - make the game

Regista / Team Manager was created by me in 2017 during my IT studies as a part of BSc Thesis. 
I did a comparision between systems for managing football teams and noticed very important part of the football is missed - developmnent of a player.

Now it is time to bring this project back to life, just like me returning to playing football after a few years. 

Updates:
- Updated Django from 1.11 to 3.2

High level backlog:
- Review existing code and model desing
- Add tests to cover existing code
- Create documentation
- Finish basic functionality
